# Crew Assignment Project Setup and Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd crew_assignment_project
```

3. Create a new Python environment using Conda.
```
conda create --name crew_assignment_env python=3.8
```

4. Activate the new environment.
```
conda activate crew_assignment_env
```

5. Install the required dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Set up the PostgreSQL database. Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine. Create a new database and update the `DATABASES` configuration in `settings.py` with your database name, user, and password.

7. Run the migrations to create the database schema.
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

8. Start the Django development server.
```
python manage.py runserver
```

9. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

10. To run tests, use the following command:
```
python manage.py test
```

Remember to review the code and ensure the `settings.py`, `urls.py` for both project and app are set up correctly. Also, ensure that forms are created and referenced properly.
